        <h4>Investment Bonds are debt instruments in which the authorized issuer owes the bond holders a debt. Depending on the terms of the type of bonds, the authorized issuer is obliged to pay interest and/or repay the principal at a later date upon maturity. In simpler terms, a bond is a formal
         contract to repay borrowed money with an interest at fixed intervals. Investment bonds are a way to raise money. When you purchase any type of bond (government, convertible, callable, etc.), you are lending money to the issuer which may be a corporation, the government, a federal agency or any other entity. In return, the issuer promises to pay a specified rate of interest during the life of the bond. The issuer also repays the face value of the bond when upon maturity of the term.
